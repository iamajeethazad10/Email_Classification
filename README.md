# Email_Classification
  The goal of the project is to identify emails in the given day based on the inappropriate content.

- Inappropriate emails would demotivates and spoil the positive environment that would lead to more attrition rate and low productivity and Inappropriate emails could be on form of 
  bullying, racism, sexual favoritism and hate in the gender or culture, in today's world so dominated by email no organization is immune to these hate emails.

- The goal of our project is to identify such emails in the given day based on the above inappropriate content and help Customers/Users to See whether the mail or message which they 
  received is abusive or non abusive.

- In this project we are having Unstructured and Huge volume of data and we have done EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and done Lemmitization, Stemming, Converted to lower Cases, Removed 
  Punctuation, REGEX, etc..., we have done the visualization like WORD CLOUD, Pie Chart, etc...., and have resampled the data.
  
-  Then we have model Building Using Different Machine Learning Algorithm Like SVM(Support Vector Machine) Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes. 
   And we have done boosting Algorithm Like ADABOOST,XGBOOST, etc. 

- we have deployed our model using SVM Classifier it was having accuracy 95% and we have deployed the project using Streamlit.
